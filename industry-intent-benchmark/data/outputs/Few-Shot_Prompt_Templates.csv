5-shot,"You are a smart manufacturing assistant. Your task is to extract structured manufacturing intents from user instructions.
The structured intent consists of:
- Scope of Service
- Things
- Activity
- Outcome

Return the intent in this JSON format:
{
  ""Scope of Service"": ""..."",
  ""Things"": ""..."",
  ""Activity"": ""..."",
  ""Outcome"": ""...""
}

Below are some examples:
User Instruction: ""The system must perform pick → pick → pick on the robotic arm as part of warehouse handling to achieve item retrieved → item retrieved → item retrieved.""
Structured Intent:
{
  ""Scope of Service"": ""warehouse handling"",
  ""Things"": ""robotic arm"",
  ""Activity"": ""pick → pick → pick"",
  ""Outcome"": ""item retrieved → item retrieved → item retrieved""
}
User Instruction: ""Please pick → pick → pick → pick the robotic arm to support warehouse handling, expecting item retrieved → item retrieved → item retrieved → item retrieved.""
Structured Intent:
{
  ""Scope of Service"": ""warehouse handling"",
  ""Things"": ""robotic arm"",
  ""Activity"": ""pick → pick → pick → pick"",
  ""Outcome"": ""item retrieved → item retrieved → item retrieved → item retrieved""
}
User Instruction: ""The system must perform unload → unload → unload on the high-bay warehouse as part of inventory unloading to achieve item removed from storage → item removed from storage → item removed from storage.""
Structured Intent:
{
  ""Scope of Service"": ""inventory unloading"",
  ""Things"": ""high-bay warehouse"",
  ""Activity"": ""unload → unload → unload"",
  ""Outcome"": ""item removed from storage → item removed from storage → item removed from storage""
}
User Instruction: ""The system must perform unload → unload → pick on the high-bay warehouse, robotic arm as part of inventory unloading, warehouse handling to achieve item removed from storage → item removed from storage → item retrieved.""
Structured Intent:
{
  ""Scope of Service"": ""inventory unloading, warehouse handling"",
  ""Things"": ""high-bay warehouse, robotic arm"",
  ""Activity"": ""unload → unload → pick"",
  ""Outcome"": ""item removed from storage → item removed from storage → item retrieved""
}
User Instruction: ""Carry out unload → pick → pick tasks through high-bay warehouse, robotic arm for the objective of inventory unloading, warehouse handling, resulting in item removed from storage → item retrieved → item retrieved.""
Structured Intent:
{
  ""Scope of Service"": ""inventory unloading, warehouse handling"",
  ""Things"": ""high-bay warehouse, robotic arm"",
  ""Activity"": ""unload → pick → pick"",
  ""Outcome"": ""item removed from storage → item retrieved → item retrieved""
}
